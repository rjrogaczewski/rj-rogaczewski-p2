For my project I created a Sports Trivia Game with 3 simple queestions. The program with allow the user to select between 4 multiple choice answers per question. If the user gets it right, it will show you that you got it correct and then highlight the button you chose green.
If you did not get it correct it will tell the use that you got it incorrect and proceed to highlight the answer chosen, red.
