For my project I created a Sports Trivia Game with 3 simple queestions. The program with allow the user to answer 3 different questions about sports(Hint the answers first letter is always capital). If the user gets it right, it will show you that you got it correct and then add a point to your score. If you did not get it correct it will tell the use that you got it incorrect and proceed to the next question. When the user finishes the game it will say game is over and then prompt you on how to play again if they wish to.
